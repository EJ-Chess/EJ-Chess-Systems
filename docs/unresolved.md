# Unresolved Issues

## [2026-03-25] TUI default readLine closure not covered by tests

**Requirement / Bug:**
The default argument `() => scala.io.StdIn.readLine()` in `TUI.scala` is never
invoked by any unit test, because all tests inject a mock `readLine`. Scoverage
reports this closure as uncovered (invocation-count=0).

**Root Cause (if known):**
Intentional design: the default argument exists for production use only. Testing
it would require blocking on stdin or spawning a separate process, which is
out of scope for unit tests.

**Attempted Fixes:**
1. Deliberate exclusion — no fix attempted.

**Suggested Next Step:**
Accept as a known gap. Class-level coverage remains above the 95% threshold.
No action required unless a headless integration test suite is added.

## [2026-03-25] ChessGUI + ChessApp excluded from scoverage

**Requirement / Bug:**
ChessGUI and ChessApp cannot be covered by automated tests because the JavaFX
lifecycle (Application.start, Stage, Platform.runLater) requires a running
display server and JavaFX Application Thread that are not available in headless
CI/test environments.

**Root Cause (if known):**
JavaFX requires a native window system. Headless testing with TestFX was deemed
out of scope for this feature.

**Attempted Fixes:**
1. Scoverage exclusion configured in core/build.gradle.kts via excludedFiles.

**Suggested Next Step:**
Add TestFX as a test dependency and write a headless smoke test that launches
the application with a mock GameManager to verify board rendering and button callbacks.
